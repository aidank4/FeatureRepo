Hey Jeff,

Thank you for teaching such an awesome class!

My feature was recreating the type of shooting in Slapshot: Rebound.

I wanted to make a basketball game where shooting is based on your mouse movement speed and your positional change.

You can test it out in the game and there is a controls screen for help on how to play!

Example of how it works:
If you want an arching shot you can start your shot looking towards the ground and release looking up towards the sky
And if you want the shot to be fast you would do that start and release quickly

The longer it takes you to release your shot the slower it will be, also if there is a small difference in your starting position to your release position it will also be slower.
The faster you release and or the greater the positional difference will make your shot faster.

Lastly, if you hold your shot for 3 seconds without releasing, then the ball won't sho0t and you can take your shot again. The idea being for a pump fake.

Thank You!
